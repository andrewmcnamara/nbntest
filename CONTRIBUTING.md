# Contributing
Third-party patches and pull requests are going to be essential for increasing the support of modems and creating new statistics to monitor.

Face it, I can't afford to go buy every possible modem that is on the market.

## Getting Started
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* [Create an issue](https://github.com/freman/nbntest/issues/new), assuming one doesn't already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce it when it's a bug.
  * Detail any work arounds if you've figured them out.
  * Include any logs and screenshots.

## Submitting modems
Ideally you'll cloned the repo and build a modem module complete with all the information it needs and submit it as a merge request (or patch)

Failing that you'll have a lua telnet or lua http (comming soon) script that tells me how you're getting the information from your modem.

Failing that I'll accept issues with scripts in your language of choice that show me how you're getting the information from your modem.

Failing that a putty log of you getting the information from your modem via telnet (please edit this log and remove the credentials, maybe put in the default credentials if you know them)
